This plugin allows you to filter WooCommerce products by color from sidebar widget.

== Description ==

Color Filters for WooCommerce plugin allows you to filter WooCommerce products by color. Now you can use a simple and beautiful widget on your WordPress online store powered with WooCommerce for product filtering by color. Everything you need is to create color filters by writing color name and selecting the corresponding color from color picker and select appropriate color or colors from the list when creating or editing your WooCommerce products. It's like adding attributes to your products, but in this case you can show available product colors in widget at any sidebar or any widgetized area of your website and most important is that you can filter products of selected color. This plugin is highly recommended for clothing stores and similar where you actually need to show available product colors. It will save a lot of time for your online store visitors and enhances their shopping experience.
